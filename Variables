A variable is a name for a piece of computer memory that has been set aside for you to store, retrieve, and use data 

  

int: integer numbers 

double: floating-point numbers 

char: characters 

string: a sequence of characters 

bool: true/false values 

  

To declare a variable called score thats an integer, say: 

int score; 

  

In C++, variable names consist only of upper/lower case letters, digits, and/or underscores 

  

You can set score to a different value by saying: 

score=0 

  

You can take int score and score=0 into one line of code by saying: 

int score=0 

  

+=addition 

-=subtraction 

*=multiplication 

/=division 

%=modulo(remainder) 

  

In: 

int age = 28; 

std::cout << "Hello, I am "; 

std::cout << age; 

std::cout << " years old\n"; 

This will say "Hello I am 28 years old" 

  

You can also do: 

std::cout << "Hello, I am " << age << " years old\n"; 

  

When asking for input, use: 

std::cin>>(whatever you want to ask) 

  

For example: 

std::cin>>tip;

A complier can translate C++ programs to machine code 

  

To compile a file, use g++(file name) 

  

To execute code files, you need to type "./" 

followed by the machine code file name 

  

CPU stands for Central Processing Unit 

  

If we want to name the machine file name, use -o (file name) 

Example: 

g++ hello.cpp -o hello 

  

Single line comments are //, and multiple line comments are /* and *\ 

 

Use command prompt to do this on Windows

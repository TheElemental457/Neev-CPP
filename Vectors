To use vectors, use the header #include <vector> 

  

Syntax to create a vector: 

std::vector<type> name; 

  

Example of creating a vector of integers called "calories_today" 

std::vector<int> calories_today; 

  

A vector is a dynamic list of items that can shrink and grow in size 

  

To initialize a vector, use this syntax: 

std::vector<double> location = {42.651443, -73.749302}; 

Here we are giving latitude and longitude 

  

To initialize vectors without knowing the values we want to put in, say: 

std::vector<type> name(amount); 

  

In a vector, the first item's index is 0, second is 1, etc... 

  

To find an individual element, the syntax is: 

nameofvector[n-1] 

  

To add an element to the end of a vector, use: 

nameofvector.push_back(elementname) 

  

To remove elements from the back, use: 

nameofvector.pop_back() 

  

To find the number of elements in a vector, use: 

nameofvector.size() 

  

Neat code example on how to change each value of a vector: 

for (int i = 0; i < vector.size(); i++) { 

  vector[i] = vector[i] + 10; 

}

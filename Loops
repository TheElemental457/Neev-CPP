A while loop is an if loop but continues running until the condition outputs false 

  

Syntax: 

while (condition) { 

  statements 

} 

  

A for loop is a loop to repeat something a certain amount of times 

  

Syntax: 

for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) { 

  std::cout << "I will not throw paper airplanes in class.\n" 

{ 

  

This for loop will repeat 20 times 

  

i++ is the same thing as i=i+1 

  

Decrementing Syntax: 

for (int i = 20; i > 0; i--)  

{ 

  // Statements 

}

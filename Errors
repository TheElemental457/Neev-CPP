There are two types of compile time errors: 

  

Syntax errors: 

Errors that occur when syntax is violated 

  

Type errors: 

Errors that occur when there is a mismatch between the types we declared 

  

Some common syntax errors are: 

Missing semicolon  

Missing closing parenthesis , square bracket , or curly brace 

  

Some common type errors are: 

Forgetting to declare a variable 

Storing a value into the wrong type 

  

A link time error happens when the program needs some library of function it cannot find 

  

When programs get bigger, it is good to separate programs into different files 

  

Examples of link time errors: 

Writing a function that was never defined 

Writing main() instead of main() 

  

A run-time error happens when the program runs but the computer is unable to do something reliably that it is told to 

  

An example of a run time error is: 

Division by 0 

Tying to open a file that doesn't exist 

  

A logic error happens when a program provides incorrect input 

  

This happens a lot to beginners and are the hardest to find
